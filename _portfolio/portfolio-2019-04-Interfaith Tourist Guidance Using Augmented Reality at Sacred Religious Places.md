Background
======
Religious tourism is a form of tourism where tourists are interested to visit the place due to its religious importance; the concept as a term has emerged as a result of the understanding of tourists inspirations about such places. It has a long history that people are traveling to the sites which they are considering holy according to their beliefs and worship concepts. Therefore, religious tourism includes visiting local, regional, national or international pilgrimage centers, attending religious ceremonies, conferences and celebrations, and all other religious related meetings.

This research is focusing on interfaith behavioural aspects of tourist of different religions during religious heritage site visits of other religions. This study has found the comparison of the behaviors of the people of different faith regarding the respect, protection and following the rules of the sacred heritage sites. Using Augmented Reality (AR), we proposed a solution for the demonstration about the rules
and regulations which are necessary to follow by the travelers to maintain the respect of these places.

Introduction
======
Teams may present either a concept (a clear, detailed design specification that can be taken to prototype), or a fully realized prototype. Either way, teams must clearly illustrate their design decisions and demonstrate the design processes that have been followed.
