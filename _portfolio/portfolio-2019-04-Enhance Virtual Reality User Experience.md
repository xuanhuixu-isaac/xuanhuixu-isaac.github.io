Background
======
The subcommittee chosen is “Interaction Techniques, Devices, and Modalities”, which focuses on advances in interaction and enabling technologies, as well as, explorations of emergent computing domains and experiences. The topic of this paper is about enhancing the user experience (UX) in Virtual Reality (VR). By exploring the recent papers that describe substantive improvements on the current VR headset or user interact function, this paper would discuss about what we could do to create a better way for user to interact with VR environment and devices. Not only a more immersive environment experience, but also an efficient and natural interaction interface. The structure of the paper is as follows: Firstly, the papers about a better interface (hand track) would be discussed. Secondly, some interesting way of hacking human perceptron to achieve better VR UX would be introduced. Then, one of VR shortages would be pointed out, overcame by two different techniques. Last but not least, some suggestions about the future research will be given.

Introduction
======
Unit Introduction, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a broad discipline and often involves collaboration by researchers and practitioners across many fields including computer science, psychology, engineering, design and social science.

The inter-disciplinary nature of HCI is reflected in the literature and also in the structure of the major international conference in the field – the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (ACM CHI). ACM CHI is one of the largest and most highly cited publication venues in all of Computer Science. Diversity is one of its great strengths.

When authors submit a paper to ACM CHI they are required to select a [subcommittee](https://chi2018.acm.org/selecting-a-subcommittee/). Some subcommittees are very technically focused (e.g. Engineering Interactive Systems and Technologies). Others are more focused on human understanding (e.g. Understanding People: Theory, Concepts, Methods) and on the application of new technology in domains such as health care (e.g. Health, Accessibility and Aging).
