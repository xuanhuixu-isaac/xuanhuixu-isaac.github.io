IEEE VR 2023, the 30th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces will be held from March 25th through March 29th, 2023 at the Pudong Shangri-La Hotel in Shanghai, China.

Their goal is to provide the best hybrid conference experience for physical and virtual attendees, learning from the historical footsteps of the successful physical or virtual experience of past IEEE VR conferences. Considering the possible time difference between on-site and online participants, they introduce a new double-time mode to the conference that records the live paper sessions and replays them after 12 hours (Shanghai night time) so that online participants may attend the conference at their convenient time anywhere on earth.
