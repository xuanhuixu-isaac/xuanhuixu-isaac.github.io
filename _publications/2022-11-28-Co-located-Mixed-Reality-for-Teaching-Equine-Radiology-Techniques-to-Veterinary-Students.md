The limited laboratory equipment and access to large animals hinder training of students in diagnostic imaging and radiology. Virtual Reality (VR) has been utilized to overcome these problems. However, those systems are designed for human radiology; hence, they are not designed for co-located multi-user collaboration that is essential when dealing with large animals. We propose a collaborative co-located Mixed Reality (MR) system for training students in radiology techniques by utilizing passthrough cameras in VR head-mounted display. It will synchronize the lecturer and the students, limit their exposure to X-rays, and allow staff to guide the students in a real-time MR environment. The hand-tracking touchless interaction provides a more instinctive and hazard-free learning experience.
