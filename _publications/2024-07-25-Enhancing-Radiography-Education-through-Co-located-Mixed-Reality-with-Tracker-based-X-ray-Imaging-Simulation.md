This poster proposes a co-located collaborative Mixed Reality (MR) teaching system to enhance Veterinary Radiography training. By integrating real X-ray equipment with virtual representations of horses, the system simulates radiographic procedures effectively. The cost-effective setup combines real equipment with virtual annotations, such as collimation beams, to achieve synchronized virtual objects and generate real-time radiography. This innovative approach enables instructors to demonstrate equine techniques and assess students?�? proficiency more effectively. An expert review study was conducted to gather feedback and evaluate user experience related to this novel teaching approach.
