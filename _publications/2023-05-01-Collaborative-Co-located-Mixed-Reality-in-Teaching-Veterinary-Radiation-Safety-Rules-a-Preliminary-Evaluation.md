When learning radiographic techniques on horses, veterinary stu-dents must be familiar with radiation safety rules, which are essential to avoid potentially dangerous exposure to the x-ray beam. We pro-pose a collaborative co-located Mixed Reality (MR) system for training students on radiation safety rules allowing staff to guide the students to practice positioning for radiography safely. The performance of 22 veterinary students was measured before and after they had grouped training sessions using the system. The result showed that the participants performed significantly better in the post-test. This evaluation illustrates the potential of expanding the technique into other subjects.
