The objective of the study is to compare a smartphone AR self-learning application with a non-AR smartphone app teaching tool to see which one will more effectively support veterinary students&apos; self-learning. To achieve this, participants will install a mobile application and use it as a self-learning support tool. Feedback will be obtained via a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey in the app at the end. But beyond this common questionnaire, the study will compare the training efficiency and training effectiveness between the AR mode and non-AR mode, exploring the impact on student&apos;s learning motivation and knowledge acquisition. This will be achieved by leveraging the remote nature of the experiment by recording the time taken within the application and future results of the participants who are Veterinary medicine undergraduate and postgraduate students from a university in Ireland and a veterinary medical university in UK.
