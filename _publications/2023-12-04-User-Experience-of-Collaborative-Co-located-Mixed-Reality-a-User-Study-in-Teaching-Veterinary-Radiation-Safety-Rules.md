As part of the clinical training during their degree course, veterinary students learn how to safely obtain radiographs in horses. However, this can sometimes be challenging due to ethical considerations related to the use of live animals and the fact that it is strictly dependent on the caseload of the veterinary teaching hospital. This networked setup allows the lecturer to guide students in equine radiographic techniques without requiring actual horses or an X-ray machine. A study involving veterinary students showed promising results regarding the effectiveness of using MR to teach radiation safety while performing radiographic techniques on horses. In addition to performance metrics, we employed questionnaires, including MREQ, VRSQ, and UEQ, to collect demographic data and participant feedback. Participants praised the system?ï¿½?s pedagogical effectiveness and overall user experience. The immersive MR experience created a sense of presence and co-presence, underscoring the potential for broader applications of co-located MR in radiology and other areas.
