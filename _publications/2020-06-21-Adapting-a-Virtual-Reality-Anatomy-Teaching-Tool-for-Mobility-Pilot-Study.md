Abstract 
------ 
During the last decade, there has been an increase in the development of training systems based on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This paper describes work in progress on exploring the challenges in the creation of anatomy simulators for professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. Given the current limitations of workstation powered VR headsets which are primarily their lack of mobility both for a given machine and the Head Mounted Display (HMD) which is commonly tethered. This lack of mobility limits the efficiency of communications between the lecturers and students. This work explores using AR-based smartphone version and mobile VR HMD as an alternative. This work-in-progress paper describes the comparison between the mobile platform AR and mobile immersive headset VR in different aspects of Veterinary Education.
