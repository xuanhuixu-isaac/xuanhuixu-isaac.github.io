Abstract 
------ 
Advances in virtual immersive and augmented reality technology, commercially available for the entertainment and gaming industry, hold potential for education and clinical use in medicine and the field of radiology. Radiology departments have begun exploring the use of these technologies to help with radiology education and training. The purpose of this article is to address how skills have been developed in the gaming world and how these can be adopted for radiology education. Radiology is rapidly evolving with the use of AI for more effective diagnostic and prognostic clinical assessment. Advances in computing technology have enabled widespread availability of simulated reality technologies, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This work in progress paper describes VR and AR technologies as novel means to communicate and have potential for supplementing radiology training...
