{% t publication.abstract %} 
------ 
Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) provide a novel way to support medical education, helping medical students learn human anatomy and surgery. Veterinary students face additional learning challenges, as they need to deal with many different species. The same techniques may potentially address the problems associated with increased class sizes. A systematic review was carried out for existing articles up to 30/06/2021 in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane Reviews, CNKI and Xplore. Searches from Google Scholar and other resources are also acceptable. PRISMA guidelines were adhered to when reporting the results of this study. The electronic searches generated a total of 425 studies. One additional record was identified through other sources. After applying inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, a total of 22 studies (887 participants) were identified for inclusion in the review. The systematic review reported the current state of VR/AR/MR applications in veterinary education. The simulator was generally used to support the training process with mainly haptic feedback and the learning outcomes could be further enhanced if adapted to the vet curriculum. There are some initial explorations on applying VR and AR in several subjects and the preliminary results showed that the MR techniques had great potential to be utilised in the daily teaching routine. However, further investigation is still needed.
