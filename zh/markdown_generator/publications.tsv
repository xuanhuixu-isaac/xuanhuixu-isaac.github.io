2018-08-15	Delaying when all dogs to go to heaven: virtual reality canine anatomy education pilot study	"2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)"	"Virtual Reality(VR) has long been theorized as a perfect training tool. The success in training airline pilots using flight simulators has demonstrated this be true in one use case. This has logically lead to interest in exploring ways of training other professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. This paper takes a different approach in examining the use of VR in summative rather than formative assessment. It reports on how using open source tools, CT scans can be converted into a working 3D model that can be used to assess anatomy students abilities. These students already have individual access to a cadaver which would be considered the gold standard method of Anatomy education. So the research problem is to examine the advantages of summative assessment using VR where currently best practise is merely a multiple choice exam(MCQ)."	"X. Xu, E. Mangina, D. Kilroy, A.

2020-06-21	A Snapshot of the Future: Virtual and Augmented Reality Training for Radiology	2020 6th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)	"Advances in virtual immersive and augmented reality technology, commercially available for the entertainment and gaming industry, hold potential for education and clinical use in medicine and the field of radiology. Radiology departments have begun exploring the use of these technologies to help with radiology education and training. The purpose of this article is to address how skills have been developed in the gaming world and how these can be adopted for radiology education. Radiology is rapidly evolving with the use of AI for more effective diagnostic and prognostic clinical assessment. Advances in computing technology have enabled widespread availability of simulated reality technologies, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This work in progress paper describes VR and AR technologies as novel means to communicate and have potential for supplementing radiology training..."	"X. Xu, E. Mangina, D. Kilroy, K. M. Curran, J.

This paper describes work in progress on exploring the challenges in the creation of anatomy simulators for professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. Given the current limitations of workstation powered VR headsets which are primarily their lack of mobility both for a given machine and the Head Mounted Display (HMD) which is commonly tethered. This lack of mobility limits the efficiency of communications between the lecturers and students. This work explores using AR-based smartphone version and mobile VR HMD as an alternative. This work-in-progress paper describes the comparison between the mobile platform AR and mobile immersive headset VR in different aspects of Veterinary Education."	"X. Xu, D. Kilroy, E. Mangina and A.

2020-11-01	An asymmetrical remote learning system for sharing anatomy between an HMD and a light field display	26th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology	"VR remote learning is an environment-friendly approach for anatomy learning compared with the paper-based, physical model or prepared specimens. However, VR devices can potentially be costly pieces of equipment, and inexperienced users can experience unwanted symptoms like motion sickness. To solve these problems, an asymmetrical system has been developed to connect an experienced head-mounted-display user (lecturer) with light field display users (students) through the Internet. The scenes of lecturer's end and students' end are adjusted to match the corresponding displays technologies."	"X. Xu, X. Pan, and A. G.

2021-05-18	"3D Displays: Their Evolution, Inherent Challenges & Future Perspectives"	Future Technologies Conference(FTC) 2021	"The popularity of 3D displays has risen drastically over the past few decades but these displays are still merely a novelty compared to their true potential. The development has mostly focused on Head Mounted Displays (HMD) development for Virtual Reality and in general ignored non-HMD 3D displays. This is due to the inherent difficulty in the creation of these displays and their impracticability in general use due to cost, performance, and lack of meaningful use cases. In fairness to the hardware manufacturers who have made striking innovations in this field, there has been a dereliction of duty of software developers and researchers in terms of developing software to best utilize these displays. This paper will seek to identify what areas of future software development could mitigate this dereliction. To achieve this goal, the paper will first examine the current state of the art and perform a comparative analysis on different types of 3D displays, from this analysis a clear researcher gap exists in terms of software development for Light field displays which are the current state of the art of non-HMD-based 3D displays. The paper will then outline six distinct areas where the context-awareness concept will allow for non-HMD-based 3D displays in particular light field displays that can not only compete but surpass their HMD-based brethren for many specific use cases."

2021-06-01	METAL: Explorations into sharing 3D Educational content across Augmented Reality Headsets and Light Field Displays	2021 7th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)	"Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality become increasingly popular in scientific visualization especially for education where they can support collaborative scientific visualization experiences in the classroom. However, the inherent limitations of head-mounted AR and VR tools are stemming the popularization of these existing content-sharing tools. Instead of sharing 3D educational content between AR/VR headsets, this paper proposes a novel prototype Mixed rEaliTy shAring pLatform (METAL) to allow for 3D educational content to be shared between a Microsoft HoloLens 2 and multiple Looking Glass displays which are a type of Light Field (Multi-view Autostereoscopic) display. This platform allows one teacher to use HoloLens to manipulate and share different 3D contents with multiple student groups via the network, thus each student group can observe the synchronized 3D educational content with autostereoscopic experiences. Therefore, this proposed prototype enables a low-cost one-to-multiple 3D content sharing experience that allows the intuitive 3D model interaction and seamless communication between the students and the teacher."

2021-06-04	HMD-based Virtual and Augmented Reality in medical education: a systematic review	Frontiers in Virtual Reality 2021	"Background: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies provide a novel experiential learning environment that can revolutionise medical education. These technologies have limitless potential as they provide in effect an infinite number of anatomical models to aid in foundational medical education. The 3D teaching models used within these environments are generated from medical data such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Computed Tomography (CT), which can be dissected and regenerated without limitations.

Methods: A systematic review was carried out for existing articles until 11/02/2020 in Embase, PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane Reviews, CNKI, OneSearch (University College Dublin Library) using search term: (Virtual Reality OR Augmented Reality OR mixed reality) AND (""head-mounted"" OR ""face-mounted"" OR ""helmet-mounted"" OR ""head-worn"" OR oculus OR vive OR HTC OR hololens OR ""smart glasses"" OR headset AND (training OR teaching OR education)) AND (anatomy OR anatomical OR medicine OR medical OR clinic OR clinical OR surgery OR surgeon OR surgical) AND (trial OR experiment OR study OR randomized OR randomised OR controlled OR control) NOT (rehabilitation OR recovery OR treatment) NOT (""systematic review"" OR ""review of literature"" OR ""literature review""). PRISMA guidelines were adhered to in reporting the results. All studies examining the people who are or were medical-related (novel or expert users) were included.

Result: The electronic searches generated a total of 1241 studies. After removing duplicates, 848 remained. Of those, 801 studies were excluded because the papers did not meet the criteria after reviewing the abstract. The full text of the remaining 47 papers was reviewed. After applying inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, a total of 17 studies (1050 participants) were identified for inclusion in the review.

Conclusions: The systematic review provides the current state of the art on head-mounted device applications in medical education. Moreover, the paper discusses trends towards the future and directions for further research in head-mounted VR and AR for medical anatomy education."	"X. Xu, and A. G.
