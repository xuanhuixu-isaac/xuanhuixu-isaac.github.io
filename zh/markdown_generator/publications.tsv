2018-08-15	Delaying when all dogs to go to heaven: virtual reality canine anatomy education pilot study	"2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM)"	"Virtual Reality(VR) has long been theorized as a perfect training tool. The success in training airline pilots using flight simulators has demonstrated this be true in one use case. This has logically lead to interest in exploring ways of training other professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. This paper takes a different approach in examining the use of VR in summative rather than formative assessment. It reports on how using open source tools, CT scans can be converted into a working 3D model that can be used to assess anatomy students abilities. These students already have individual access to a cadaver which would be considered the gold standard method of Anatomy education. So the research problem is to examine the advantages of summative assessment using VR where currently best practise is merely a multiple choice exam(MCQ)."	"X. Xu, E. Mangina, D. Kilroy, A.

2020-06-21	A Snapshot of the Future: Virtual and Augmented Reality Training for Radiology	2020 6th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)	"Advances in virtual immersive and augmented reality technology, commercially available for the entertainment and gaming industry, hold potential for education and clinical use in medicine and the field of radiology. Radiology departments have begun exploring the use of these technologies to help with radiology education and training. The purpose of this article is to address how skills have been developed in the gaming world and how these can be adopted for radiology education. Radiology is rapidly evolving with the use of AI for more effective diagnostic and prognostic clinical assessment. Advances in computing technology have enabled widespread availability of simulated reality technologies, including virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). This work in progress paper describes VR and AR technologies as novel means to communicate and have potential for supplementing radiology training..."	"X. Xu, E. Mangina, D. Kilroy, K. M. Curran, J.

2020-06-21	Adapting-a-Virtual-Reality-Anatomy-Teaching-Tool-for-Mobility-Pilot-Study	2020 6th International Conference of the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)	"During the last decade, there has been an increase in the development of training systems based on Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). This paper describes work in progress on exploring the challenges in the creation of anatomy simulators for professionals such as Doctors and Veterinarians. Given the current limitations of workstation powered VR headsets which are primarily their lack of mobility both for a given machine and the Head Mounted Display (HMD) which is commonly tethered. This lack of mobility limits the efficiency of communications between the lecturers and students. This work explores using AR-based smartphone version and mobile VR HMD as an alternative. This work-in-progress paper describes the comparison between the mobile platform AR and mobile immersive headset VR in different aspects of Veterinary Education."	"X. Xu, D. Kilroy, E. Mangina and A.

2020-11-01	An asymmetrical remote learning system for sharing anatomy between an HMD and a light field display	26th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology	"VR remote learning is an environment-friendly approach for anatomy learning compared with the paper-based, physical model or prepared specimens. However, VR devices can potentially be costly pieces of equipment, and inexperienced users can experience unwanted symptoms like motion sickness. To solve these problems, an asymmetrical system has been developed to connect an experienced head-mounted-display user (lecturer) with light field display users (students) through the Internet. The scenes of lecturer's end and students' end are adjusted to match the corresponding displays technologies."	"X. Xu, P. Xingyu, and A. G.
