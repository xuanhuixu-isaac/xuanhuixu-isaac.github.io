Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Student under the supervision of [A.Prof Abraham G. Campbell](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abraham-Campbell) at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), [School of Computer Science](https://www.ucd.ie/cs/). My research focuses on Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) application in Medicine and Veterinary Education, collaborating with [A.Prof David Kilroy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZvmpRrEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof Arun Kumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kfWW5x4AAAAJ&hl=en) from the [School of Veterinary Medicine](https://www.ucd.ie/vetmed/).

I have broad interest in exploring new techniques relating to VR and AR, such as photogrammetry scan, motion capture, and face tracking. Meanwhile, I am also trying to be an influencer and sharing my research output and experience with others.
