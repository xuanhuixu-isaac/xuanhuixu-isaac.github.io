I am currently a **Research Scientist** at University College Dublin, where I **lead and manage** equipment and projects within the Virtual Reality (VR) Lab, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across academic schools while the head of the lab is away. I actively **mentor** final-year project and doctoral students, guiding their research and professional development, while also contributing to various outreach and research initiatives. In the Autumn semester of 2024/2025, I served as an **Adjunct Lecturer** for the Augmented and Virtual Reality module, where I designed and updated course content based on the provided lecture notes, delivered lectures and lab sessions, and assessed student performance. Previously, as a **Guest Lecturer**, I provided expertise in developing VR applications and conducting user studies in veterinary education. My teaching experience also includes roles as a **Teaching Assistant** and **Demonstrator** across multiple modules, such as Game Development and Computer Programming, where I supported course delivery, guided students, and facilitated their learning through hands-on sessions.

My research explores the application of Mixed Reality (MR) in veterinary education, with a focus on enhancing teaching methods and assessment practices. I have published over 20 peer-reviewed publications in leading journals and conferences, including **ISMAR (`A*`)**, **SIGGRAPH (`A*`)**, **VRST (`A`)**, and **IEEEVR (`A*`)**, and have been awarded the **Government of Ireland Postdoctoral Fellowship**. I actively contribute to the academic community as a reviewer for journals and conferences, helping to shape the evolving fields of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.

I have broad interest in exploring new techniques relating to VR and AR, such as photogrammetry scan, motion capture, and face tracking. Meanwhile, I am also trying to be an influencer and sharing my research output and experience with others.
