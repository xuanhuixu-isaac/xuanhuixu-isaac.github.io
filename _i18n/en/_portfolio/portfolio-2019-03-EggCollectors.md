Background
======
You are controlling two workers who are trying to catch eggs as they are laid by a collection of chickens arranged in a line. As a chicken is about to lay an egg, it visibly changes, and you have to get a catcher to the right area to collect the egg in his/her basket. If a basket gets too full, new eggs are likely to break existing eggs, so new hay must be got on top of the old eggs. If the two catchers run into each other, they are likely to drop the eggs from their baskets. As controller, you must move the catchers to places where eggs will drop and where hay will be added. Get as many eggs within a time limit as necessary, and be promoted to a better job where the eggs are laid more frequently and/or more quickly; or be fired from your job (game over) if too many eggs get broken.
