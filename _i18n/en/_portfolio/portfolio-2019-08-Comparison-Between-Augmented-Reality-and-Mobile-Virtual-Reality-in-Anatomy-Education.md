Proposal
======
The main aim of the project is to compare the learning experience between mobile AR and mobile immersive AR. By converting current UCD fixed VR experience into the mobile immersive environment user experience, the comparison between those two becomes possible. The following objectives will be completed to achieve this aim:
1. Convert veterinary lab application based on the PC platform into Android platforms and adjust the features and functions to adapt to the mobile environment by using ARCore SDK or Vuforia SDK.
2. Create an image target anchor to achieve the information shared between multiple devices. Furthermore, if capable, development world anchor or cloud anchor to implement this feature.
3. Design an experiment about comparing the efficiency of using two different mobile AR devices and get the outputs to do the analysation for the results. The project would including a review of existing literature related the use of AR and immersive AR in education before the starting the creation of the AR/ Immersive AR applications.
