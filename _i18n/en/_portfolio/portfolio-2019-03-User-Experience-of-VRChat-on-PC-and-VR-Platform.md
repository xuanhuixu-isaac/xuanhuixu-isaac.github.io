Background
======
Virtual reality (VR) is a way of using technology to create environments designed for expressly human interaction. By wearing the VR headset, users are completely drawn into a whole new world which allows them to interact with their virtual environment in a way which is not possible using any other medium. VR headsets are supposed to be more interactive, engaging and pleasant way while connecting to the virtual world as compared to desktop.

Virtual reality is improving more and more as a competitive technology every day. It is revealing innovative applications in the teleconferencing that can revolutionize socializing experience and co-working and industries as well. As VR continuously growing and improving, the experiences are feeling more real. 

To figure out if VR could bring better user experience, we proposed the hypothesis as: “When using virtual reality version of a teleconference application, users will communicate more efficiently as compared to the desktop version of the same application.” 

To prove our hypothesis we used VRChat (a freeware application on Steam) as our target application because it has both the VR version and desktop version. By using VR headsets with VRChat software, users can work on a virtual whiteboard, collaborate in work with other users, bring other tools in, and, most importantly, get around a table together as a conference. It allows the teams to get connected and hear each other in a much more effective and engaging way as compared to other online meeting software.
